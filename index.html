				Another implementation of Conway's Game of Life in javascript!
				How new and original, right?  This implementation does not
				include any graphical elements in the core repository and is
				only handling the computations involved.  For the most part it
				has been used when trying to explain concepts in javascript to
				other people but it works quite well in its own regard!
			</p>

			<p>
				Conway's game of life is a fairly simple zero-player game which
				revolves around cellular automaton following a small set of
				rules to change state.  The rules are related to the neighbors
				surrounding a specific cell.
			</p>

			<p>
				The rules are thus:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Any live cells with less than two live neigbors dies</li>
				<li>Any live cells with two or three live neigbors lives</li>
				<li>Any live cells with more than three live neigbors dies</li>
				<li>Any dead cells with exactly three live neigbors lives again</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				There are many known patterns in this game which give known
				results.  Pictured left are spaceships, specifically Schick
				ships.
